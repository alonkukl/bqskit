# Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit)

**The core BQSKit code is still being actively developed and is currently
missing a few features that will exist in the full release. These are
primarily performance based, and we expect the compiler to improve in
this regard significantly in the coming months. Sign up on the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/g/bqskit)
to be the first to hear about updates.**

BQSKit is a superoptimizing quantum compiler and synthesis tool.
It has been designed to perform three main tasks: global circuit
optimization, quantum synthesis, and circuit parameter optimization.
However, it can perform many more functions.
